# Open Source contributions

This project tries to gather information about
[open source](https://opensource.org/osd) contributions made by
[Adapt](https://adaptagency.com/).

This is not the complete list of contributions that Adapt has done, but a useful
set that can be used.
For now it contains information mainly starting at 2021.

## How to add entries

Feel free to post new additions:

- Add a new PR, or
- Send some lines/links at slack #contributions channel.

I both cases please at-mention Marco.

## YAML format

The YAML file tries to be self-explanatory, when in doubt just ask on slack.
It tries to describe contributions thinking in possible future use of the data.
